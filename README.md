# form-validator
Small script to check form fields against a defined set of rules

#Purpose
Mostly learning + showcasing skills. I know there are many well documented form validation tools out there, just wanted to create my own to build something that has real-world application. If you have strong server-side validation of forms, then this may be a great little tool to improve UX when submitting the form.

#Approach
I used an object + methods to validate the form. I liked this approach because it gives flexibility. I can use .call() to apply the methods to other forms that may exist on the same page.
